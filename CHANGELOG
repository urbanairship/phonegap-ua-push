=================================
Version 1.0.2 - November 16, 2012
=================================
- Updated to PhoneGap 2.2.0
- FIXED: setting an alias to an empty string results in subsequent
  registration failures in the iOS plugin
- Updated default value of UAPush to NO in NSUserDefaults on app launch, 
  this only affects the iOS plugin. This feature requires v1.3.5 of
  libUAirship.a or greater, this implementation is not backwards compatible
  with previous versions of the Urban Airship push library without modifying 
  the Objective C code. Previous behavior caused registration for push when 
  registerForRemoteNotifications was called, the current behavior will record 
  preferred remote notification types and defer push registration until the
  pushEnabled value is set to YES.

=================================
Version 1.0.1 - August 23, 2012
=================================
- FIXED: Addressed crash in the Android plugin caused by Cordova library bug when push or
  registration events occur before the web view is initialized.
- FIXED: Addressed JSON bug resulting in invalid push extras.
- Removed Urban Airship library from iOS and Android sample projects. See the documentation at
  https://docs.urbanairship.com/display/DOCS/Client%3A+PhoneGap for more information
